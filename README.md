*DESCRIPTION*: This project demonstrates big data analysis using PySpark on a real-world taxi fare dataset from Kaggle. It showcases how scalable processing can be achieved even with moderate hardware by leveraging the PySpark engine for efficient data transformations and aggregations.

Objective:
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using PySpark on a taxi fare dataset.

Extract and analyze time-based features such as hour, weekday, and month.

Derive insights like average fare by hour and day of the week.

Demonstrate scalability through the use of PySpark for parallel data processing.

Tools & Technologies
->Python 3

->PySpark

->Dataset: NYC Taxi Fare Prediction

Dataset Description
The dataset contains:

pickup_datetime: Timestamp of pickup

fare_amount: Fare paid in USD

pickup_longitude and pickup_latitude

dropoff_longitude and dropoff_latitude

passenger_count

Key Insights
->Average fare by hour

->Average fare by weekday

->Cleaned and filtered data based on fare ranges and missing values

->Time-based features extracted for deeper trend analysis
